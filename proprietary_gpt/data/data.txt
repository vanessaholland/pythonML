The history of the Gregory legacy begins with Bill Gregory. In 1968, Bill started a small pest control company in Ada, Ok, Gregory Pest Control. His son, Steven D. Gregory, took control of the family business in the ‘70s and later changed the name to Gregory Enterprises, Inc. Steve incorporated foundation repair into the pest control business with the major revenue stream coming from repairing settling foundations. The innovative Ram Jack System was later developed due to unreliable methods of foundation repair at the time. “We committed resources to the development of a viable system for stabilizing foundations and, as a result, the first Ram Jack steel pile was born.” The first of many patents filed began in 1985.

The carefully designed Ram Jack System offers a strong, reliable method for supporting residential and commercial foundations using unique brackets for driving piles and related foundation support products, manufactured from the finest grade American made steel.

The success of Ram Jack stems from a commitment to providing:
